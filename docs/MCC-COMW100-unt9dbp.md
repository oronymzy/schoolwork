# Websites with media that can be added to web pages

When I look for websites with reusable media, my priority is licensing. Just grabbing a random image from Google [might result in legal action](https://torrentfreak.com/using-googled-images-can-result-in-license-demands-and-legal-threats-181103/). For permissively-licensed content, I recommend the following:

- For video, both [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) and [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/) have videos with [Creative Commons licenses](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/). YouTube has no easy way to search for them, but Vimeo, at least, has [a page dedicated to browsing videos with Creative Commons licenses](https://vimeo.com/creativecommons).
- For music, there is [ccMixter](http://ccmixter.org/view/media/home), a remix-based music site with a reasonably active user base. They have [an extensive query API](http://ccmixter.org/query-api) that includes the option to search by license. I would also recommend [the Free Music Archive](http://www.freemusicarchive.org/), but to my great sadness [they seem to be closing](http://freemusicarchive.org/member/cheyenne_h/blog/Big_Changes_Ahead_for_FMA). To anyone interested, look to [Archiveteam's page](https://www.archiveteam.org/index.php?title=Free_Music_Archive) for more information going forward.
- For audiobooks, there is [LibriVox](https://librivox.org/), a website dedicated to community recordings of public domain books. Their [advanced search](https://librivox.org/search) does not offer an option to search by license, but there's no need for it since [all of their work is in the public domain](https://librivox.org/pages/public-domain/).
- For sound effects, there is [Freesound](https://freesound.org/). They have a wide variety of sounds, and you can [search by license](https://freesound.org/search/?q=).
- For clipart, there is [the Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/). Lots of their stuff is permissively licensed, although they lack a way of searching by license.
- For everything else, there is [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page), a huge repository of [permissively-licensed content](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Licensing) that you are [free to use](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:First_steps/Reuse).

Additionally, Wikipedia has [a list of major Creative Commons licensed works](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_major_Creative_Commons_licensed_works) that you can check out. Full disclosure: I've contributed to this list.

I find all of these websites valuable because they can enrich [Internet culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_culture) and enable people to legally collaborate on creative works.
