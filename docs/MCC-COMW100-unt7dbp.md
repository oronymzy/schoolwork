# Website critique of blackboard.mcc.edu

This might hit a little close to home, but I do have some legitimate criticisms of the Blackboard-driven areas of the MCC website. I use this site because it's required for school. A good thing about it is that it usually does the job of letting me interact with my classmates and instructor. However, here are some things that would make it better:

- **Mobile support.** I'm 30 years old, and the UI is basically the same as it was when I used Blackboard in high school. MCC's main website and the Backpack area of the website both have mobile support, so why not Blackboard? If Blackboard's developers are not actively maintaining the software, why not switch to an alternative like [Moodle](https://docs.moodle.org/35/en/About_Moodle), which [is actively maintained](https://github.com/moodle/moodle/releases), has a responsive design, and has its own app? I genuinely hope someone with knowledge of the MCC website can give me an answer to this.
- Web syndication support. Currently, my smartphone can only get class updates via emails sent by the instructor. RSS or Atom feeds should be standard so students can know when announcements are sent, grades are submitted, or someone replies to their post on the discussion board.
- Collaboration support. If students are able to work together in a classroom they should also be able to work together online in real time without relying on third-party tools like Google Docs.

I was unable to find anything useful on the first two points with cursory Googling. If anyone knows of workarounds to enable mobile and web syndication support, please let me know.
