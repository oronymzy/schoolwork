# My thoughts on web site consistency

My opinion is that a web site's consistency is important. At minimum, a website should have consistent navigation on the top and/or bottom of each page to make sure the user doesn't get lost. That said, as long as the edges of each page come from a consistent template, the bulk of the interior need not limit itself too much. Blogs, for example, might have varied center areas with more consistent structure at the edges. Another example I can think of is GitHub, where each project can have a README file with widely varying content that is derived from a variant of Markdown-formatted text. Things like images, hyperlinks, and code blocks can be arranged at will, while the upper part of the page maintains a consistent interface across different projects.
