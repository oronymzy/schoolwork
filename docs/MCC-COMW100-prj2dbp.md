# Some plans for my site (continued)

Continuing my site's topic of [Tyson Tan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyson_Tan)'s mascots of permissively-licensed software, I will be adding four pages with four additional mascots, thankfully discovered through the [mascots section of Tyson Tan's website](https://tysontan.com/#panel4). My goal is to make all pages mobile-ready, satisfying the requirement of making at least two pages mobile-ready. A form will be used to send an email, possibly to Tyson Tan directly to thank him for his work, if that's appropriate. The project also requires audio and video, so I'll be including [a local sound file of a woodpecker](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Picoides_pubescens_drumming_Roberts_Bird_Sanctuary,_Minnesota.ogg) and [an embedded video of a woodpecker from YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyYXG9YSK1g). A table will be included on the intro page comparing apparent qualities of the different mascots. I might also expand some of the existing pages from the first project. Here are the four pages I'll be adding:
