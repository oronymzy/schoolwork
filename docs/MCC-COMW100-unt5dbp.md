# My thoughts on communication in web site management

Communication presents difficulties under most circumstances, and I would expect communication with people who do not share my technical background to be especially difficult. My approach to making a communicative website would be to make things as streamlined and user-friendly as possible, and separate any background information into “basic” and “advanced” sections depending on the user's level of interest. My approach to team communication would be to point people at educational resources to help someone expand their functional knowledge in how to do something or, if there's enough time, walk them through it step by step. As far as a customer changing an order midway through, I guess I'm fine with that, as long as they're clear that the site will be a perpetual work-in-progress until they make up their mind.
