# The Public Domain Review

[The Public Domain Review](https://publicdomainreview.org/) is a blog-like website that curates and promotes notable works in the public domain. Its target audience seems to be everyone, judging by its general use of black text on a white background and judicious use of eye-catching graphics. Although it is not targeted at any group in particular, the fact that its text can be easily enlarged in a web browser makes it accessible to older adults. It is not aimed at children, although it does have [a small section labeled “children's book”](https://publicdomainreview.org/tag/childrens-book/). It also seems to be designed with responsive web design in mind, slowly modifying its layout based on the zoom level, and it presents a minimal version on mobile devices. On the other hand, its images do not seem to have text descriptions, which would hinder accessibility.
