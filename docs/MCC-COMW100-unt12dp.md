# Critique of Joomla Geeks

This week I chose to critique the portfolio of [Joomla Geeks](https://www.joomlageeks.com/), a web design company. I did some searching for a web design company that used open-source software, and a company with *[Joomla](https://www.joomla.org/)* in the name was the best I could do. Joomla Geeks at least [uses Joomla for their web development](https://www.joomlageeks.com/services/web-development/), though I saw no evidence that the websites they created were released under a [free software license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software_license). Going through [their portfolio](https://www.joomlageeks.com/portfolio/), some of the linked websites did not load (not the fault of Joomla Geeks, but still frustrating), and eventually settled on [Blue Sky Roofing](http://www.blueskyroofinginc.com/), [City of Kennesaw](https://www.kennesaw-ga.gov/), and [scarsdale10583.com](http://scarsdale10583.com/) (I couldn't find a more descriptive title for the last one). I like the clean and professional look of Blue Sky Roofing, and I can appreciate the functionality of the other two sites, although scarsdale10583.com looks rather cluttered. All three sites seem functional and well-organized, and this company could be a good option for someone looking for a web design company.
