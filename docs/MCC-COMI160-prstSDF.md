# a presentation for Sir Donald's Fast Food
This is the Markdown-formatted source for a [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) presentation I intended to present to Sir Donald's Fast Food (actually presented to my coursemates, since Sir Donald's is fictional). Ultimately, it was recreated in LibreOffice Impress as a PPSX to comply with course requirements. The slides have been rearranged to match [the accompanying business proposals](MCC-COMI160-sfbpSDF.md).
