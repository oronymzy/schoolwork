# selected fictional business proposals for Sir Donald's Fast Food
After inventing a fictional company (*My Irresistible Technology Company*) and a fictional potential employer (*Sir Donald's Fast Food*), throughout the class I wrote brief business proposals for ways I could improve the technological capabilities of my potential employer. Some of the more memorable proposals are collected below, with minor modifications. There is also [an accompanying presentation](MCC-COMI160-prstSDF.md).


## executive summary

Sir Donald's fast food, based out of Cuba, needs My Irresistible Technology Company! We are experienced at existing under states of oppression, so relocation is not a problem for us. We know how to capitalize on the weaknesses of competitors, and we are always learning new techniques employed by local governments. We perpetually innovate to preserve autonomy, adapting to a world that can be hostile toward capitalism. We prioritize the security and privacy of our customers. And we minimize business speak.


## proposed networking

My potential employer, Sir Donald's fast food, has twenty locations exclusively in Cuba, though they are considering expanding into international waters with “float-thrus” servicing cruise liners and hungry pirates. Internet access in Cuba is decidedly spotty, and the mid-Atlantic is slightly worse, so that will factor in to my recommendations for them.

Due to the oppressive nature of the local government, any serious computer networking will be necessarily clandestine, so this rules out the physical connections required in a wired network. Wireless technologies would work best, and I recommend integration with the local Street Network (SNET) maintained by Cuban citizens. If they are serious about going international, my potential employer will need practice at self-promotion in the style of trendy LARPers. As far as I know, the Cuban radio waves are entirely unregulated, so there's lots of potential for sharing videos of medieval-themed shenanigans.

By providing “gifts” to the necessary government officials, the southernmost restaurant will gain access to the Cuban (read: Venezuelan) Internet. This location will serve as an ISP for the other locations, with several roof-mounted directional antennas forming a star network of connections to the closest locations. From there, a smaller-scale wireless mesh network utilizing SNET will fill in the gaps. This is what my potential employer should want because it provides a future avenue for them to embed targeted advertisements in the grassroots social network.

Outside of the primary ISP location, the restaurants should use a peer-to-peer network for resilience, with each one of them employing disruption-tolerant networking technologies to keep talking amongst themselves even in times of Internet outages. Potential customers can visit these interconnected locations, send messages to their friends, then wait for a reply while sitting and enjoying a burger, fries, and king-for-a-day-soda. Rest assured that My Irresistible Technology Company is mindful of cybersecurity threats, and has a long history of keeping sensitive communications safe from prying eyes.

The extent of coverage will vary depending on location on the island, but each restaurant will have its own local area network, and this can be extended through numerous personal area networks forming nodes in the mesh network. Practicing with this kind of heterogeneous networking will come in handy for future expansions onto the high seas, where floating restaurants will often be spaced quite far apart, and may need to resort to IP over Avian Carriers or even sending messages in a bottle.


## proposed security

For Sir Donald's fast food, there is a need for both hardware security and software security.

The capability of physically securing a device to a particular location, as if it were something more mobile like a bicycle, will reduce common theft and arbitrary government acquisition. Most laptops are already equipped with security slots that could be used to attach cable locks.

As far as I can tell, Cuba has a reasonably reliable electrical grid, but it would still be prudent to install a few surge suppressors and uninterruptible power supplies at the southernmost restaurant location to protect crucial computers. For any services venturing out into the Atlantic, ruggedization of portable devices will also be important to protect against the elements.

There is a certain amount of built-in data resilience to the decentralized system to be installed by My Irresistible Technology Company, since identical copies of information are distributed among many nodes. However, for critical financial information, at least two data backups should be maintained at separate locations.

Extensive work will need to be done to protect against unauthorized access to company systems. Threats exist in terms of both ill-intentioned civilians and oppressive government agents.

Employees will need to given individual accounts and passwords or passphrases as part of an access control system. Two-factor authentication could add additional security. There will be vulnerabilities as long as human elements are present in the system, but it is possible to minimize unauthorized access.


## proposed system development

Sir Donald's fast food requires modernization of their pre-Internet system of antiquated computers and paper-based records. Their southernmost restaurant location will serve as the starting point for a pilot conversion to a more modern system.

Because a large portion of my potential employer's information system will be distributed and reliant on a large number of ordinary individuals, the preliminary investigation will focus on interviewing existing customers to determine if they are willing to act as network nodes. It will be made clear that their contributions to the company as part of the end-user development approach will be released under a permissive license.

An approximation of the user interface of the Sir Donald's app to be distributed to customers will be created. The app will enable customers to order food remotely, and will enable mesh networking. A method will be devised of encrypting the app and disguising it when not in use, to hide the customer's activities from unfriendly prying eyes. Documentation will be made publicly available, possibly as a wiki.

Hardware to make the southernmost location into an acting ISP will have to be acquired surreptitiously or produced internally, since the Cuban government is unlikely to approve of our activities. The company can use permissively-licensed software to be acquired for free through online sources.


## proposed hardware

Because Sir Donald's fast food will be using a largely distributed network, a large number of inexpensive desktop computers with moderately-powered CPUs, moderate memory, and several ports will suffice for day-to-day operations. Several will be needed for cashiering, as well as at least one dedicated machine for recordkeeping. The southernmost restaurant acting as an ISP will need a more powerful computer, or perhaps a series of them, to handle Internet traffic. It may be possible to combine many processors to achieve better performance through parallel processing, and liquid cooling of the components may also be necessary.


## proposed software

Because my company specializes in open-source and permissively-licensed software, that will limit the scope of my software recommendations to Sir Donald's fast food.

There are a variety of operating systems that can be freely downloaded, modified, and distributed. The bulk of my experience is with [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/), particularly [Kubuntu](https://kubuntu.org/), which uses a [KDE](https://www.kde.org/)-style desktop. The Kubuntu GUI strongly resembles [Windows](http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows), so it should make for a smooth transition for anyone accustomed to Windows.

The Kubuntu operating system is my recommendation for Sir Donald's fast food because it is affordable, flexible, powerful, and can be maintained by a local team of programmers in Cuba, even without contact with the original programmers.

Kubuntu provides a wide variety of application software in the form of downloadable packages from a software repository. Applications can also be downloaded through personal package archives or installed from files in the *deb* file format. Linux-based systems generally have a diverse community of programmers working on a wide variety of different applications. In addition, if any employees of Sir Donald's fast food have programming experience, they can participate in the development and maintenance of their software through websites like [GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), or [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/) or, alternatively, since Internet access is likely to be spotty in Cuba, through locally-hosted collaboration software like [Gitea](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea). For a fast food company, here is a list of GUI-driven application software that I would specifically recommend:

- [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) for raster graphics editing and [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/) for vector graphics editing.
- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/) for web browsing.
- [The LibreOffice suite](https://www.libreoffice.org/) for word processing, spreadsheets, presentations, and database management.
- [VLC media player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) for media playback.

Additionally, there is CLI-driven application software I would recommend for more specific tasks:

- [beets](http://beets.io/) for the organization and playback of permissively-licensed music.
- [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) for converting files between different formats.

This collection of application software is my recommendation for Sir Donald's fast food because it will help produce promotional material, browse the Web for freely-available information on fast food, manage expenses, play music in restaurants, and make company documents available across different platforms.
