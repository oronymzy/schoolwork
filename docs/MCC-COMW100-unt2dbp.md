# Free Music Archive

The [Free Music Archive](http://www.freemusicarchive.org/) is a long-running site that provides permissively-licensed music for listening and download. I've downloaded lots of music from it over the years, and I recommend it to anyone looking for music that can be legally downloaded and shared.

The good: music can be found with a [search](http://freemusicarchive.org/search/) or by browsing [a list of artists](https://freemusicarchive.org/music/). Licensing is clearly indicated, and music collections often come with additional metadata. The Free Music Archive also maintains a presence on social media and releases occasional blog posts.

The not-as-good: the website design is somewhat dated and does not have a simplified version for mobile devices. The downloaded music also tends to be in MP3, not a lossless format like FLAC. I also have a personal nitpick about the apparent lack of documentation on how to perform advanced searches. My recommendation is to either publish documentation on the existing website software or modernize the site, preferably while letting the community contribute to it with permissively-licensed source code.
