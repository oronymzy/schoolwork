# My thoughts on logging web site changes

Regardless of motivation, I think keeping track of changes to a website is a good idea. Based on my very limited experience using Git, I think there's a lot to be gained on both a personal and group level from learning to use a version control system. The most obvious advantage is damage control, the ability to fall back on a previous version if something goes wrong with a website, and after that the ability to compare versions to identify a problem. A disadvantage might be the cost associated with learning to change one's workflow and the extra time required to communicate changes with other individuals on the same project.

I'm not currently employed, so I'm unaware of regulations requiring logging or version control, but I support their voluntary adoption, as I think there are far more advantages than disadvantages.
