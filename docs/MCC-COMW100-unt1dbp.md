# My experience with web sites

So far, my experience at web site building has been fairly basic. I've used WordPress to build a web site, and recently I've settled into generating a site from Markdown-style text files using static site generators like Jekyll. I prefer to [keep the content separate from the presentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_content_and_presentation), and enjoy finding other content creators who share that philosophy.

I've published intermittently to social media, most often on Reddit. I've also edited Wikipedia, if that counts. I tend to avoid Facebook, since it's important to me that my social media contributions be visible to the public. Old-fashioned blogging appeals to me the most.
