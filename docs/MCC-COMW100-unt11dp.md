# Critique of Mastodon

This week I needed to critique a social networking web site, so I tried out *mastodon.social*, a popular instance of [Mastodon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(software)). Mastodon is a permissively-licensed piece of software for building a [federated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation_(information_technology)) social networking server. It can be thought of as a more decentralized version of Twitter, with some differences in terminology like *toots* in place of *tweets*. For anyone else looking to try it out, I recommend reading [the Verge's article on Mastodon](https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/7/15183128/mastodon-open-source-twitter-clone-how-to-use), which helped me understand some of the software's quirks.

mastodon.social has a nice website layout, with plain colors and charming graphics of a cartoon proboscidean. I liked the fact that after registration I got an introduction with an explanation of how the software works, who the admin was ([Eugen](https://mastodon.social/@Gargron)), what the [community rules](https://mastodon.social/about/more) were, and especially where the [source code](https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon) could be found. Soon after registering, I encountered an error page, but at least it had [a cute animation](https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/blob/master/public/oops.gif). Adding a bio to my profile was easy and intuitive. The website's interface is based on consecutive columns and it takes some getting used to. Although the theme is a very readable dark bluish with light text, I would recommend that the site provide an option to use a lighter overall theme. I couldn't find one by casually searching.

If anyone wants to say hello, my handle is `@oronymzy@mastodon.social`.
