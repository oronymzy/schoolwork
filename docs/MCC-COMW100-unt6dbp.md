# Mott mobile website top 10 items

I'm not sure how useful this list will be, since [the Mott website](https://www.mcc.edu/) already has a mobile version, but here are the top 10 things I would include in a mobile version of the Mott website:

1. [Catalog](https://www.mcc.edu/catalog/index.shtml)
2. [Search for Classes/Sections](https://www.mcc.edu/registration/reg-search-for-classes-sections.shtml)
3. [Academic/Registration Calendar](https://www.mcc.edu/academics/acad_calendar.shtml)
4. [Student Success Services](https://www.mcc.edu/student_services/ss_index.shtml)
5. [e-Learning](https://www.mcc.edu/elearning/index.shtml)
6. [MCC4Me](https://4me.mcc.edu/)
7. [Contact Us](https://www.mcc.edu/mcc_contact.shtml)
8. [Sitemap](https://www.mcc.edu/mcc_sitemap.shtml)
9. [Newsroom](https://www.mcc.edu/newsroom/)
10. [Important Dates](https://www.mcc.edu/important_dates/)

I would prioritize the material related to classes, students, and online resources at the top. Below that would be contact information and a sitemap, and at the bottom would be a periodically-updated list of posts regarding the newsroom and important dates.
